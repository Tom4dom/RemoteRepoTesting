Description of my repo:
Just trying to understand how it works. I'm going to use git clone; git push; git pull commands.

2. git clone it to my hard thus create my local repo
3. Make some changes in it locally
4. git push it
5. Make some changes remotely and then 
6. git pull it back to my drive with new strings in it
